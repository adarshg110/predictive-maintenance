# predictive-maintenance

Heavy industries require frequent maintenance  of their equipment. But upgrading machines very frequently is not cost effective method. Meanwhile performing very less maintenance may affect the production of final product by decrease in quality and quantity. 

So the best possible method is to follow predictive maintenance. As the name suggests the machines are constantly monitored using machine learning models and the goal is to predict the proper maintenance time. Thus reducing the cost in maintenance and making the quality of product constant. 
But the data being very inconsistent requires a lot of data pre-preparation. In this project I have done careful data formatting and cleaning to optimise my data for implementing it by machine learning models.
Best possible algorithms have been chosen for prediction based on dimensions and features of the data and their correlation. These are the main factors wile choosing an algorithm. While many ignore the exploratory data analysis concept. I have taken it in to account while performing the project. Which gave me good idea about the features of the data and their correlation. Byt he following knowledge I was able to choose my algorithms appropriately and get the hyper parameters on the point for best possible outcome.
I am additionally planning to implement other algorithms such as support vector regression, which I believe will maybe provide better results on this data, If implemented properly.
